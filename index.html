			<p class="info">
				Back in Middle School I used to play an MMO game called MapleStory(circa '07-'09). At that time,
				on that MMO, game hacking was not a huge thing. So I was pretty amazed and in awe when one day I
				found myself near the old Henesys Free Market and there was a player flying above everyone else's heads.
				I immediately sent that player a trade request out of fascination to get their attention and ask some
				questions on how they were doing that. They pointed me to an old game cheats forum where I began downloading
				cheats others had made and using them in the game. It was a blast until I got my first ban on mine and my
				older brother's account. He was pretty mad. But we got over it and my curiosity and craving for more knowledge
				in that area of expertise returned. This time I wanted to know how to make my own cheats. So I began asking
				the pros and creators of the cheats around on the forum site for any little bit of information or direction
				they could point me in to set me on the path to making my own.<br>
				<br>
				Some various kind souls sent me down the research rabbit hole(having 40+ tabs open) and thus began my journey.<br>
				I started out just updating other people's old Cheat Engine scripts(known as AASM or Auto Assembler scripts).
				Auto Assembler is Cheat Engine's assisted scripting for the machine language; ASM(so I guess you could technically
				say that my first ever programming laguage was ASM, though it was a bit more messy and I didn't entirely know what
				I was doing. :P). But I still craved more knowledge. I wanted to make an actual injectable dll and program like
				others had done for the game. So I started self teaching some C++ but ended up getting overwhelmed 'cause I didn't
				know where to start. My research skills were not the best at the time and code was literally a foreign language to
				me. So I ended up holding off on that until I got to High School and saw they had some programming classes I could
				take. Though it was in Java, I figured it'd still help to understand code better in general. It definitely did.<br>
				<br>
				I ended up taking Java programming for two years in High School. The first time around was pretty rough but I still
				enjoyed it and passed it nonetheless. After High School I was a bit more ready to learn and less overwhelmed
				by the C++ tutorials I had been looking at previously. Since Java and C++ are both heavily OOP languages;
				transitioning from Java to C++ was easier this time. So I learned a lot about C++ and how to code some basic programs
				and then found some tutorials on how to put the game cheats into my code, made my first cheats, and the rest is history.
				I've continued learning/self-teaching C++ along with dabbling in many other programming languages along the way for
				the past 11+ years now and feel like I still learn something new every day and I love every bit of it. When your code
				compiles without errors and you feel all nice and smart is such a great moment. Keep that spark for knowledge alive,
				dear readers!
