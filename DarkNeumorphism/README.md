## Dark Neumorphic Web Theme
This is a dark neumorphic web theme that anyone can feel free to use.

All the CSS, HTML examples, and JS to make it work is in one file(index.html) for easy copy>paste, so no having to go digging through multiple files and folder structures to see how part of it works.

The CSS is at the top of the document, the HTML is in the middle part(just after the CSS), and then the JS is at the bottom of the document right after the HTML.

So if you want to throw it into a .css, .html, and .js file you can do so with ease.

There's an example HTML element for all of the compoonents so far.
